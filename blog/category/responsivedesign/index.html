I have been involved with a wide range of responsive websites and 
web apps.
</p>
<p>Here are the posts which cover some of my thougths and findings.

{% for post in site.categories.responsive %}
<div>
	<h2><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></h2>
	<p>{{ post.date | date:"%d %b %Y" }}</p>
</div>
{% endfor %}

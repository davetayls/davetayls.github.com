My name is Dave Taylor, I was born and grew up in the Philippines
although both my parents are English. We lived on the edge of an
active volcano called Mayon (which means beautiful). It was a flippin
amazing place to be apart from when it errupted. let’s just say that.

I spent the first 10 years of my career in London where my love for
the web and geekery grew steadily. I had the opportunity to work on
some cutting edge projects with forward thinking creative agencies and
clients from the likes of The FA and the RFU to The British Red Cross
and Premier Inn.

I started [Pogo Kid](http://pogokid.com) in the summer of 2012 and I
now work from my office in Bath.

I’m ever curious, I love the creativity you can have with front-end
technology. This is the time to be working with HTML, CSS and
JavaScript, and I’m living on the razors edge of these 3 fantastic
technologies. Needless to say, it’s a lot of fun :o)

## Work with me

I'm always open to talking with people in passionate teams wanting to
produce great work. If you're looking for someone who will not only be
a developer on your team but will invest themselves in your project then
give me a call. Take a look at my [work with me page](/workwithme) for
more information.

## This is what excites me

 - Front-End technologies
 - Teams and open source communities
 - My family
 - Doing great work (YEAH! The _"I made that"_ feeling)
 - I love the web
 - Community
 - New stuff

## Experience
The best way to get to know my skill level and coding style is to browse my
[github projects](http://github.com/davetayls).

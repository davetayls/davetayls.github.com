<p>
	There have been lots of studies showing that over multitasking drastically reduces productivity. 
	So in an effort to keep productive I prefer to work in alocated slots of time for each client instead of purely a project by project basis.
	You can then be aware when I am focusing on your project and know when is best to contact and work through any questions.
</p>
<p>I find this streamlines and reduces the amount of admin so that costs go down and I can spend more time producing the work.</p>

<h2>Appointment slots</h2>
<p>
	I use Google Calendar to organise slots, you should see available appointments below,
	or you can go <a href="https://www.google.com/calendar/b/0/selfsched?sstoken=UUd2UGxUclZPQWVlfGRlZmF1bHR8MDQ4NGZhMzJhZTg4NzAzOWE4N2YxMGUxNGVlOTk2OWE">directly to the appointment page</a>

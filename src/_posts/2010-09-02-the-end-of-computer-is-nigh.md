intro
I had my parents over the other day and the conversation turned to "when we were young". 

the rate at which people are starting to have multiple computers in their homes doing slightly different things. It got me musing on the thought that over the next few years I expect that people will start to forget about having a computer in their home at all.

where did we come from
We used to live over in the Philippines, my parents were in their 30's and up to a point they used to communicate with family and friends back home through regular letters and tapes sent quarterly so that their parents could also hear our americanifying accents.



talk about perception


where computers are going to be
touch screens in the kitchen


integrated


consider context


positive step...get away from connotations


how this changes life for developers

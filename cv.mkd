I am a disciplined and passionate front-end web developer with **over nine years**
experience.  I listen, make good judgements on the approach and get things
done on time. I specialise in user-centric, cross-browser, HTML (4/5) / CSS
(2/3) websites progressively enhanced using JavaScript.

I get a real buzz working at the forefront of my field researching
new developments as they emerge and contributing to the developer community.  I
have extensive experience working with JavaScript from architecture to hand
coding and working with open source  library jQuery.

Experience
----------

### Senior Front-End Developer - _Aqueduct_ <http://www.aqueduct.co.uk>
#### July 2009 to March 2012 (2 years, 8 months)

I was employed by Aqueduct to build a Front-End development team where previously freelancers where used. Tasked with setting standards, overseeing code quality and putting these in to practice. With my background in design and back-end experience, I am the linchpin between the back end team, design team and front-end team. Understanding the relationships between each, I enable them work more effectively together. 

I ended up leading a team consisting of one in-house mid-weight developer and external contractors. Here are some key achievements from this role:

 - Lloyd's of London website at www.lloyds.com. This project spanned the corporate website and the migration of five in house web applications. 
 - British Red Cross corporate (www.redcross.org.uk) and Red Cross Training sites. 
 - Architecture and coding standards for Aqueduct's web
projects. 
 - The FA Just Play website (justplay.thefa.com) won Sitecore Site of the Year for it's category.
 - Feedback from my team: David is a team player and always thrives to improve himself and the teamâ€™s output as a whole, he influences people without being pedant and is always full of new ideas; he is pragmatic, skilful and has great attention to detail, he has the same goal as the rest of the team which is to deliver work we are proud of.

### Web Designer / Developer - _Qdos Computer Consultants_ <http://www.qdoscc.com>
#### Feb 2005 to July 2009 (4 years, 5 months)
 
Head of design and front-end. I worked within a team to accomplish web based application projects, corporate websites, e-commerce solutions, branding services, print design for charities and SMEs. 

### Owner/Partner - _Mime Graphics_
#### July 2002 to Feb 2005 (2 years, 8 months)

I began working as a designer in a partnership after college with the view to building a strong portfolio of work. I cut my teeth dealing with SME Account management and client relationship building, managing my time and gaining real world experience in print and website design.

This website has been my place for thoughts and experiments, ideas and memories for close to a decade. The first article on here was written in March 2010 when I was building jQuery plugins and working at Aqueduct in London. I'm still going to keep my blog going here for general thoughts but I want to collect up and pull together the more in-depth content on the [Pogo Kid](https://www.pogokid.com) website in a more structured way.

## A Small history

The [blog listing](/blog) reads as a small history of web development over the last decade. The posts on here have been a window on my thoughts at the time. They may not have caused any great waves outside of my little sphere but show the many changes in our day-to-day responsibilities as front-end developers.

## Transitioning

The last two years have been a bit of a transitioning period for me, I joined a startup called [Seccl Technology](https://seccl.tech) as their Tech Lead and put everything into making that a success. Pogo Kid was put to the side for a while. The focus was intense as you would expect, no startup I've been part of is a walk in the park. I can tell because the articles seem to have dried up on here. After I left in June and Seccl sold, I decided that I needed some sort of separation between my hobbies; my experiments; my memoriesâ€”and the technical research and thought that forms the foundation of Pogo Kid's USP.

## A Blog and More Structured Research

I have been consulting through my company [Pogo Kid](https://www.pogokid.com) for over five years now and I have never found the right point to diverge this website and make a dedicated one for Pogo Kid. Now I want to dedicate the time to allow this site to be a humble blog and the Pogo Kid website to be more structured.

I have been planning a few longer pieces of research which alongside more structured versions of some of the content on this blog will go into the Pogo Kid website. The Pogo Kid website will be focused on Software Engineering and much of the content here will be as well.

If you're starting a new JavaScript application or "Single Page App" you're likely be looking at current frameworks and trends to decide what to base the technology stack on. Each of these have their own flavour and recommendations to help you decide how code should be structured. 

When planning how a web application is architected it is important to think about the "Domains" of your solution.

Resposibilities are very important, forcing a single owner of any part of the application will keep simplicity

If layers get mixed the application will become conceptually very hard to map in your mind as it grows. This will also lead to a more tightly coupled codebase and make it harder to grow the size of the application with new features.

## Layers of Separation

Domains: logical areas or features within your application.

Jobs: 

 - network and communication
 - data state and business logic
 - interface and interaction

## notes

 - areas that deal with data
 - components and UI
 - responsibilities
 - fences
 - domains
 - scaleability
 - models - different type of models, what are models, why models
 - team size affects how you should separate your application

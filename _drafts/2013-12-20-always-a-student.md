It was great to be have [Robin Stanley](http://boffnoff.me) join me at the end of October. He joined us in our little office for a weeks work experience. I have never had a student work with me before so it was a bit of a leap in to unknown territory but I had a few thoughts as to how I could help him.

If I think back to what has helped me most in the past, I think of particular projects or problems which I had to work out. For me learning through real-life tasks has been the most effective way.

From an initial conversation It occurred to me how much I take for granted the gradual experience I have gained over many years. I guess, because I'm always learning, I still view myself as a student.

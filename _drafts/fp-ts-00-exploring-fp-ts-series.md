We've started using a lot more functional programming styles and pattens in our codebase. Part of getting better at using these patterns is choosing and knowing the tools that are available. A lot of our codebase is TypeScript and so we have settled on using the fantastic [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library.

I'll start the series with three of the most common use-cases our team needs to get their head around: handling nullable values, errors and async functions. I will try and expand on this in time.

Alongside this we've been reading [Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming](https://www.gitbook.com/book/drboolean/mostly-adequate-guide/details) along with his [video series introducing composable functional javascript](https://egghead.io/courses/professor-frisby-introduces-composable-functional-javascript). It has been helping us navigate several new concepts and ways of thinking.

So let's make a start by heading over to [Working with Nullable Values](/blog/2017/09/14/fp-ts-01-working-with-nullable-values).

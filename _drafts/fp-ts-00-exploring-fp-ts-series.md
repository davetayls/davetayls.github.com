We've started using a lot more functional programming styles and pattens in our codebase. Part of getting better at using these patterns is choosing and knowing the tools that are available. A lot of our codebase is TypeScript and so we have settled on using the fantastic [fp-ts](https://github.com/gcanti/fp-ts) library.

I'll start the series with three of the most common use-cases our team needs to get their head around: handling nullable values, errors and async functions. I will try and expand on this in time.

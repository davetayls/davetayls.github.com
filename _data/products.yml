  about: >
    The Frontend landscape moves so fast! I often am asked to recommend
    a good stack of libraries and maybe a framework which will fit well
    with a team.


    We'll have an initial Skype meeting to discuss your project and it's
    goals.


    If you have an existing codebase, I'll take a look at the current technologies
    used (both client and server side).


    I'll then put together a report for you with some background
    research and a few options for you to consider based on your goals and
    limitations.


    We'll finish with another call to go over the report and discuss your next steps.
    Please allow up to 10 working days to complete this process.
  rewards:
    - Review of your current architecture
    - Review of your future plans and goals
    - You'll receive a report giving two or three recommendations giving you help moving forward

  about: >
    I love the process of building great products. The reason I've kept my passion
    for frontend builds over the last 14 years is because I believe that together
    we can excite and delight the people using what we've created.


    I can work on-site in Bath or remotely from my office if you're based in
    London or elsewhere in the UK with regular on-site visits dependent on your location.


    I'm happy to come and meet you to discuss your project, give me a call and we can
    arrange a good time.


    My skills include: Frontend architecture, **HTML5**, **JavaScript** (OOJS, ES6, TypeScript),
    **CSS** (BEM, Less, SASS, Stylus), **Testable Code** (Mocha, Sinon, Chai, Karma), **NodeJs** (Express, Mongoose),
    **Cloud Applications** (Heroku, S3, Azure).


    I've built highly performant HTML5 cross platform applications for browsers and Cordova:
    **Canvas** and image manipulation, **Backbone**, **React** Native.
  rewards:
    - Take advantage of my 14 years of experience
    - Set good foundations to your frontend build

  about: >
    I want to see every frontend developer live inspired and creative. I believe
    we all have a child's passion inside of us which wants to do great things.


    I'm so grateful to have had the opportunity of unlocking this passion
    and to see groups of people tackle a project head on and become a team.


    I like to work closely with the project leads to really get to know each
    member of the team, put in place a pathway for them to grow technically
    and to gain the confidence to lead others.


    Ultimately I have two aims:


    1. To inspire the team and provide them with the skills they need to
       build great products

    2. To find and nurture emerging leaders to continue this work with
       those more junior than they are
  rewards:
    - Encourage and guide emerging leaders within your team
    - Build a plan to level up frontend developer's skills
    - Focus the team on building a great product experience
